## Example slide

### This is a subtitle

Before we dive a bit deeper, here is a simple example of the
[clean theme](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean)
in action. 

- No pictures or anything fancy. Just text for the moment.

Next, we'll take a brief tour of some theme components.

- We'll use the same basic
structure as the
[original LaTeX slides](https://raw.githack.com/kylebutts/templates/master/latex-slides/auxiliary/slides.pdf).
- Note that the [_full suite_](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)
of Reveal.js features are available for this Quarto implementation,
even if we don't cover everything here.


## Before you proceed...

### Requirements for the coding examples in this demo

The [clean theme](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean) is
language agnostic. Use it with R, Python, Julia, etc. Or none of the above.

However, this demo uses R code to highlight advanced theme features.
You'll need to install some software if you'd like to render the demo "as-is".

:::{.callout-warning}

## Required software (this demo only)

### R packages

```{.r}
install.packages(c("modelsummary", "fixest", "pdftools", "tinytex", "threejs"))
```
### TinyTex

```{.bash}
quarto install tinytex
```
While reveal.js presentations are HTML format, we will show an example of how to 
embed LaTeX tables as images. This requires a working Tex distribution, of which
TinyTex provides by far the easiest and lightest integration with Quarto. More
details [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html).

## Components

### Ordered and Unordered Lists

Here we have an unordered list.

- first item
    - sub-item
- second item

And next we have an ordered one.

1. first item
    i) sub-item
2. second item

## Components

### Alerts & Cross-refs {#sec-crossref}

To emphasize specific words or text, you can:

- Use the default `.alert` class, e.g. [important note]{.alert}.
- Use the `.fg` class for custom colour, e.g. [important note]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"}.
- Use the `.bg` class for custom background, e.g. [important note]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}.

To cross-reference, you have several options, for example:

- Beamer-like `.button` class provided by this theme, e.g. [[Appendix]{.button}](#sec-appendix)
- Quarto's native cross-ref syntax, e.g., "See @sec-appendix."

## Components

### Citations

Citations follow the standard
[Quarto format](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#citations)
and be sourced from BibLaTex, BibTeX, or CLS files. For example:

 - [Topic 1:]{.alert} Spatial Frictions [@Fajgelbaum_Morales_Serrato_Zidar_2018; @Hsieh_Moretti_2019; @Moretti_2011]

- [Topic 2:]{.alert} Blah [@Suárez_Serrato_Zidar_2016]

## Components

### Blocks

Quarto provides
[dedicated environments](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs)
for theorems, lemmas, and so forth. 

But in presentation format, it's arguably more effective just to use a
[Callout Block](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html).

:::{.callout-note}
## Regression Specification

The main specification is as follows:

$$
y_{it} = X_{it} \beta + \mu_i + \varepsilon_{it}
$$
:::

## Components

### Multicolumn I: Text only

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Column 1

Here is a long sentence that will wrap onto the next line as it hits the column
width, and continue this way until it stops.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Column 2

Some other text in another column.

A second paragraph.
:::

::::

Multicolumn support is very flexible and we can continue with a single full
span column in the same slide.

## Components

### Multicolumn II: Text and figures

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/kanagawa.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- A point about the figure that is potentially important.
- Another point about the figure that is also potentially important.
:::

::::

Note that sub- and multi-panel figures are also natively supported by Quarto.
See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#subfigures).

## Components

### Multicolumn III: Code and output

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: fig-pairs
#| fig-cap: "Pairwise scatterplot" 
#| fig-asp: 1
#| output-location: column

palette("Classic Tableau")

par(
  family = "HersheySans",
  las = 1, pch = 19, cex = 1.5
)

pairs(
  iris[,1:4],
  col=iris$Species
)
```

# Tables {background-color="#40666e"}

## Markdown tables

### Default table styling

The `clean` theme rolls its own minimalist aesthetic for tables. This should interface directly with Quarto's excellent
[table support](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html).

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

```md
| fruit  | price  |
|--------|-------:|
| apple  | 2.05   |
| pear   | 1.37   |
| orange | 3.09   |

: Fruit prices {tbl-colwidths="[75,25]"}
```

:::
::: {.column width="5%"}
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
| fruit  | price  |
|--------|-------:|
| apple  | 2.05   |
| pear   | 1.37   |
| orange | 3.09   |

: Fruit prices {tbl-colwidths="[75,25]"}

:::

::::


## Regression tables

### Regression example

These aesthetics should carry over to any computation-based tables too.

Let's take a few slides to illustrate via a simple regression example:

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(fixest)

mods = feols(
  rating ~ complaints + privileges + learning + csw0(raises + critical),
  data = attitude
)

dict = c("rating"     = "Overall Rating",
         "complaints" = "Handling of Complaints",
         "privileges" = "No Special Priviledges",
         "learning"   = "Opportunity to Learn",
         "raises"     = "Performance-Based Raises",
         "critical"   = "Too Critical")
```

## Regression tables

### modelsummary

Popular regression table software should play nicely with this theme out of the
box. Here's an example using [modelsummary](https://modelsummary.com/) (with the
default [tinytable](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/tinytable/)
backend^[For extra styling options (e.g., bootstrap themes), see
[here](https://modelsummary.com/vignettes/appearance.html).]). See the next
slide for the resulting table.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

library(modelsummary) # Make sure you have >=v2.0.0

modelsummary(
  setNames(mods, c("(1)", "(2)")),
  coef_map = dict, stars = TRUE,
  gof_map = NA
  ) |>
  # some optional stylistic tweaks
  tinytable::group_tt(j = list("Dep. variable: Overall Rating" = 2:3)) |>
  tinytable::style_tt(i = 1:2, j = 2:3, background = "pink")
```


## Regression tables

### fixest::etable

**Aside:** We used the fantastic [fixest](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/) package to estimate our regression models. fixest bundles its own powerful tabling functions. These were designed for LaTeX output, but can work with this (HTML) theme too.^[Details
[here](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/articles/etable_new_features.html). You need to install the `tinytex` & `pdftools` packages first.]

- Set the `output: asis` R chunk option in your Quarto doc.
- Set the `markdown = TRUE` fixest::etable option.

````
```{{r}}
#| output: asis

setFixest_etable(markdown = TRUE, drop = "Constant")
setFixest_dict(dict)

etable(mods, highlight = .("se" = "complaints"))
```
````

## Regression tables

### fixest::etable (cont.)

```{r}
#| output: asis

setFixest_etable(markdown = TRUE, drop = "Constant")
setFixest_dict(dict)

etable(mods, highlight = .("se" = "complaints"), arraystretch = 1.5)
```

# Figures {background-color="#40666e"}

## Figure

![](img/kanagawa.jpg)

## Figure

### Full-size Figures

You can use the `{.background-image}` container environment to completely fill
the slide background with an image.

Ideally, your figure will be the same aspect ratio as the screen that you're presenting on.

- This can be a bit tricky because of the dynamic nature of reveal.js / HTML. But it's probably something close to 16:9.
- Aspect ratio can also matter for a regular full-frame images (previous slide).

## {background-image="img/kanagawa169.jpg" background-size="100%"}

## Interactive plots

```{r}
#| out-width: 75%

library(threejs)

# Approximate locations as factors
data(flights)
dest = factor(sprintf("%.2f:%.2f", flights[,3], flights[,4]))

# A table of destination frequencies
freq = sort(table(dest), decreasing=TRUE)

# The most frequent destinations in these data
frequent_destinations = names(freq)[1:10]

# Subset the flight data by destination frequency
idx = dest %in% frequent_destinations
frequent_flights = flights[idx, ]

# Lat/long and counts of frequent flights
ll = unique(frequent_flights[, 3:4])

# Plot frequent destinations as bars, and the flights to and from
# them as arcs. Adjust arc width and color by frequency.
globejs(lat=ll[, 1], long=ll[, 2], arcs=frequent_flights,
        # bodycolor="#aaaaff", arcsHeight=0.3, arcsLwd=2,
        bodycolor="#fff", arcsHeight=0.3, arcsLwd=2,
        arcsColor="#ffff00", arcsOpacity=0.15,
        atmosphere=TRUE, color="#fff", pointsize=0.5)
```

_Note: Simple flight data example using `threejs`. There are many interactive
plotting options beyond this.

### What else can the clean theme do?

We have highlighted some theme-specific components in this demo.

But please note that all of the standard
[reveal.js functionality and plugins](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html)
are compatible with the clean theme. This includes:

- [chalkboard](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#chalkboard) for annotating slides.
- [multiplex](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#multiplex) for enabling audience navigation of your slides.
- [pdf printing](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) in case you don't have access to a web browser.
- Etc.
